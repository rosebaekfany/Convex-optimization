# Convex-optimization

This repository includes the code and report for the Convex Optimization course project.
---

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

This project explores **convex optimization techniques**, focusing on the application of **Semidefinite Relaxation (SDR)** to classical non-convex problems. The report presents theoretical background, problem formulations, and algorithmic approaches.

## ðŸ§© Main Topics

1. **MIMO Detection**

   * Application of SDR to symbol detection in wireless communication systems.
   * Comparison of methods: Zero Forcing (ZF), MMSE, Sphere Decoding, SDR, and Lattice Reduction.
   * Trade-offs between detection accuracy and computational complexity.

2. **Max-Cut Problem**

   * A fundamental NP-hard problem in graph theory and combinatorial optimization.
   * Reformulation using adjacency and Laplacian matrices.
   * **SDP relaxation** approach and **Hyperplane Rounding Algorithm (Goemansâ€“Williamson)** for approximation.

3. **Graph Coloring**

   * Problem setup: assigning colors so adjacent vertices differ.
   * SDP relaxation of the chromatic number.
   * Wigdersonâ€™s algorithm for 3-colorable graphs.
   * Advanced methods using the **LovÃ¡sz number** and refined **Kargerâ€“Motwaniâ€“Sudan (KMS)** algorithm.
